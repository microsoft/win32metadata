 *   Microsoft-specific extensions to the Windows NT IPX/SPX Windows
 *   Sockets interface.  These extensions are provided for use as
 *   necessary for compatibility with existing applications.  They are
 *   otherwise not recommended for use, as they are only guaranteed to
 *   work *   over the Microsoft IPX/SPX stack.  An application which
 *   uses these *   extensions may not work over other IPX/SPX
 *   implementations.  Include this header file after winsock.h and
 *   wsipx.h.
 *
 *   To open an IPX socket where a particular packet type is sent in
 *   the IPX header, specify NSPROTO_IPX + n as the protocol parameter
 *   of the socket() API.  For example, to open an IPX socket that
 *   sets the packet type to 34, use the following socket() call:
 *
 *       s = socket(AF_IPX, SOCK_DGRAM, NSPROTO_IPX + 34);
 *
 *   Below are socket option that may be set or retrieved by specifying
 *   the appropriate manifest in the "optname" parameter of getsockopt()
 *   or setsockopt().  Use NSPROTO_IPX as the "level" argument for the
 *   call.
