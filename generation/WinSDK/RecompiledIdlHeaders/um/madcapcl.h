Description:

Members:

                     is current time. The desired time is specified in the number of seconds elapsed
                     since midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970, coordinated universal time.

    MaxLeaseStartTime - the maximum start time that the client is willing to accept.
                        Where time is the number of seconds elapsed since midnight (00:00:00),
                        January 1, 1970, coordinated universal time.

    LeaseDuration - desired lease time for the request, pass 0 if default
                    lease time is requested.

    MinLeaseDuration - the minimum lease time that the client is willing
                       to accept

    ServerAddress - server's ip address where this lease whas renewed/requested.
                    pass 0 if unknown (e.g in McastRequestAddress)

    MinAddrCount - minimum number of addresses that the client is willing
                   to accept

    AddrCount - the desired number of addresses requested/allocated/renewed.
                This also specifies the size of the array specified by Addr.

    pAddrBuf - buffer containing specific addresses being requested/renewed/released.
                For IPv4 it is a pointer to 4 byte addresses and for IPv6 it
                points to 16 byte chunks. Pass NULL if no specific addresses
                are requested.

Remarks:

    In MCAST_API_VERSION_1 version, the MaxLeaseStartTime, MinLeaseDuration and
    MinAddrCount are ignored by the API implementation. However, the clients should
    set appropriate desired values for these members so as when the OS update brings
    new implementation of the APIs then the clients can take advantage of it.
