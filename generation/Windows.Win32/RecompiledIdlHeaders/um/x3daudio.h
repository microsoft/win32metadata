  NOTES:
    1.  Definition of terms:
            LFE: Low Frequency Effect -- always omnidirectional.
            LPF: Low Pass Filter, divided into two classifications:
                 Direct -- Applied to the direct signal path,
                           used for obstruction/occlusion effects.
                 Reverb -- Applied to the reverb signal path,
                           used for occlusion effects only.

    2.  Volume level is expressed as a linear amplitude scaler:
        1.0f represents no attenuation applied to the original signal,
        0.5f denotes an attenuation of 6dB, and 0.0f results in silence.
        Amplification (volume > 1.0f) is also allowed, and is not clamped.

        LPF values range from 1.0f representing all frequencies pass through,
        to 0.0f which results in silence as all frequencies are filtered out.

    3.  X3DAudio uses a left-handed Cartesian coordinate system with values
        on the x-axis increasing from left to right, on the y-axis from
        bottom to top, and on the z-axis from near to far.
        Azimuths are measured clockwise from a given reference direction.

        Distance measurement is with respect to user-defined world units.
        Applications may provide coordinates using any system of measure
        as all non-normalized calculations are scale invariant, with such
        operations natively occurring in user-defined world unit space.
        Metric constants are supplied only as a convenience.
        Distance is calculated using the Euclidean norm formula.

    4.  Only real values are permissible with functions using 32-bit
        float parameters -- NAN and infinite values are not accepted.
        All computation occurs in 32-bit precision mode.                    */
