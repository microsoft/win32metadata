Module Name:

    lmerrlog.h

Abstract:

    This module defines the API function prototypes and data structures
    for the following groups of NT API functions:
        NetErrorLog

Environment:

    User Mode - Win32

Notes:

    You must include NETCONS.H before this file, since this file depends
    on values defined in NETCONS.H.
