/*
SCOPE TYPES
===========

A scope is an entry in the "Look In" dropdown list of the Object Picker
dialog.

When initializing the DS Object Picker, DSOP_SCOPE_TYPEs are used with
DSOP_SCOPE_INIT_INFO.flType member to specify which types of scopes the
DS Object Picker should put in the "Look In" list.

DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_TARGET_COMPUTER
    Computer specified by DSOP_INIT_INFO.pwzTargetComputer, NULL is
    local computer.

DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_UPLEVEL_JOINED_DOMAIN
    Uplevel domain to which target computer is joined.

DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_DOWNLEVEL_JOINED_DOMAIN
    Downlevel domain to which target computer is joined.

DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_ENTERPRISE_DOMAIN
    All domains in the enterprise to which the target computer belongs
    other than the JOINED_DOMAIN or USER_SPECIFIED_*_SCOPEs.

DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_GLOBAL_CATALOG
    The Entire Directory scope.

DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_EXTERNAL_UPLEVEL_DOMAIN
    All uplevel domains external to the enterprise but trusted by the
    domain to which the target computer is joined.

DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_EXTERNAL_DOWNLEVEL_DOMAIN
    All downlevel domains external to the enterprise but trusted by the
    domain to which the target computer is joined.

DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_WORKGROUP
    The workgroup of which TARGET_COMPUTER is a member.  Applies only if the
    TARGET_COMPUTER is not joined to a domain.

DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_USER_ENTERED_UPLEVEL_SCOPE
DSOP_SCOPE_TYPE_USER_ENTERED_DOWNLEVEL_SCOPE
    Any uplevel or downlevel scope generated by processing user input.  If
    neither of these types is specified, user entries that do not refer to
    one of the scopes in the "Look In" control will be rejected.

/*
DSOP_SCOPE_INIT_INFO flags
==========================

The flScope member can contain zero or more of the following flags:

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_STARTING_SCOPE
    The scope should be the first one selected in the Look In control after
    dialog initialization.  If more than one scope specifies this flag,
    the one which is chosen to be the starting scope is implementation
    dependant.

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_WANT_PROVIDER_WINNT
    ADs paths for objects selected from this scope should be converted to use
    the WinNT provider.

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_WANT_PROVIDER_LDAP
    ADs paths for objects selected from this scope should be converted to use
    the LDAP provider.

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_WANT_PROVIDER_GC
    ADs paths for objects selected from this scope should be converted to use
    the GC provider.

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_WANT_SID_PATH
    ADs paths for objects selected from this scope having an objectSid
    attribute should be converted to the form LDAP://<SID=x>, where x
    represents the hexidecimal digits of the objectSid attribute value.

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_WANT_DOWNLEVEL_BUILTIN_PATH
    ADs paths for downlevel well-known SID objects (for example,
    DSOP_DOWNLEVEL_FILTER_INTERACTIVE) are an empty string unless this flag is
    specified.  If it is, the paths will be of the form
    WinNT://NT AUTHORITY/Interactive or WinNT://Creator owner.

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_DEFAULT_FILTER_USERS
    If the scope filter contains the DSOP_FILTER_USERS or
    DSOP_DOWNLEVEL_FILTER_USERS flag, then check the Users checkbox by
    default in the Look For dialog.

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_DEFAULT_FILTER_GROUPS


DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_DEFAULT_FILTER_COMPUTERS

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_DEFAULT_FILTER_CONTACTS

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_DEFAULT_FILTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS

DSOP_SCOPE_FLAG_DEFAULT_FILTER_PASSWORDSETTINGS_OBJECTS
    If the scope filter contains the DSOP_FILTER_PASSWORDSETTINGS_OBJECTS flag,
    then check the Password Settings Objects checkbox by default in the Look For
    dialog.
